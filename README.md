Learning assembly

- Use F11 to start debugging into assembly code
- Once debugger has started, be sure to open the disassembler (ctrl+alt+D) and the registers window (ctrl+alt+G)
  to step through assembly code and watch its execution



*Getting setup with new project
1) Create an empty C++ project 
2) Add a main.cpp
3) Right click on the project and select: Build Dependencies -> Build Customizations
4) Check MASM (in the dialog that appears)
5) Add a new file with extension .asm  (do this by adding header file and just renaming with .asm)
